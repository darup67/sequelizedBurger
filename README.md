A burger logger web application that uses MySQL, Node, Heroku: JawsDB, Heroku Deployment, Express, Handlebars, and homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and uses Handlebars to generate the HTML.

# How It Works

Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page; waiting to be consumed.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a button to eat it. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Burgers on the right side of the page have a delete button to remove it from view.
The app stores every burger in a database whether eaten or not.

# Design

Burger Log is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- The app stores every burger in a mySQL database, whether devoured or not.


- Follows Model View Controller (MVC) pattern
